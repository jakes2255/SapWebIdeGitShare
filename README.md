Sharing contents between developers using GitHub

## Problem with SCP Git Repo
While using the Git Repositories available on SAP Cloud Platform, one of the limitations is that it forces teh second developer to enter the credentials of first developer while cloning the repo and alos when pushing changes to the repo.</br>
This may not be possible in real time scenarios.

### Overcoming the problem with GitHub

Instead of using the SCP Git Repo, use a GitHub repo, public visibility used here</br>
However private with a common corporate repo could be used for specific scenarios.
